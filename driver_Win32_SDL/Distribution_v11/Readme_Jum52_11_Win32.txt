Jum's A5200 Emulator, Win32/SDL Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

12 January 2010

This is an Atari 5200 emulator for Windows.

The 6502 CPU emulator source is heavily based on a distribution
by Neil Bradley. The POKEY sound emulator is a modified version 
of Ron Fries POKEY emulator.
The rest is by me.

Changes (v1.0 to v1.1):
~~~~~~~

- Implemented key remapping to make it easier to use with
  arcade controller panels.
- Implemented 3x and 4x scaling
- Fix to 2nd fire button handling ("top" side buttons) 



Compatibility:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most carts will run.

These games give problems:
- Decathlon
- Mr. Do's Castle (corrupt rom dump)
- Quest for Quintana Roo
- Rescue on Fractalus

Joystick Modes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Options Menu, select joystick mode by toggling "Controller" (press left or right arrow key while on the Controller option).

Pengo control mode is automatically activated when Pengo cart is loaded.

Many games do "auto-calibrating" while you play. Moving the joystick handle in a big circle while chanting "work dammit" usually gets it working OK. Also it sometimes helps if you leave the analog stick in the central position when starting a game.

If you activate joystick mode, and the game does not control as
expected, then try reloading the game.

Only a standard 2-axis / 2-button joystick and a MS Sidewinder have been 
tested.



Mouse Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~

This is useful for playing Missile Command or other trackball games.

From the Options Menu, select "Mouse" mode by toggling "Controller" (press left or right arrow key while on the Controller option).



MousePaddle Mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is useful for games that use a paddle, such as:
KABOOM!
Gorf
Breakout

From the Options Menu, select "MousePaddle" mode by toggling "Controller" (press left or right arrow key while on the Controller option).



Getting started:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need:
- A PC
- Some 16k or 32k Atari 5200 cartridge images

1. Copy the cartridge images into the same directory as the
   Jum52_win32.exe file.
2. Run Jum52_win32.exe 
3. Have fun!



Configuring Jum52:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set options for Jum52 by editing the jum52.cfg file. The 
options you can change are:
    - audio output (on/off)
    - voice emulation (on/off)
    - audio volume
    - fullscreen mode (on/off)
    - default controller (keyboard/joystick/mouse)
    - default control mode (normal/robotron/pengo)
    - video output scale (1/2)
    - alternate palette file
    - slow-motion mode (on/off)
    - extra (custom) cartridge mappings
    - keyboard remappings

1. Make a copy of jum52.cfg (call it "jum52.cfg.bak" or something).
2. Edit jum52.cfg with Notepad or some other text editor.
3. Set the options as you prefer (valid options are in brackets).
4. Save jum52.cfg.

You can also add mappings for "unknown" 16k roms (eg: if you're
writing a homebrew game and you want to test it in Jum52 :). In this
case, take a look at the sample mappings in jum52.cfg. You can get 
the CRC of the rom by running it in Jum52, then looking in the 5200.log file. 


Keyboard Remapping:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remap the keys used in Jum52 by adding key mappings to the
jum52.cfg file. The format is:

keymap=<in code>,<out code>

# where <in code> and <out code> are ASCII or extended key codes 
(code 0 to code 320).

eg: To use the "Home" key as the "Start" key for Jum52, we need to 
remap "Home" key (code 278) to the "F1" key (code 282):

keymap=278,282

(You can get a list of the key codes by Googling "sdl_keysym.h").



The debugger:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** Skip this is you're not a 5200 programmer :) ***

The debugger has functions that allow you to stick your fingers into 
the moving parts of the 5200 while it is running:
- Info on the 6502, ANTIC, GTIA registers
- 6502 disassembly with nice 5200 hw reg info
- step thru 1 instruction, 1 scanline, or 1 frame
- run to an address
- view the current character set and PM graphics data
- view the collision registers
- view the DLIST data (sorry no DLIST disassembler :{ )
- view the interrupt vectors
- view data at an address
- some other stuff useful to programmers

To enable the debugger, set the "debug" option in jum52.cfg to "yes", 
then restart Jum52.

To get to the debugger while running a game, press F4.

Press 'h' when in the debugger to get a list of available commands.
