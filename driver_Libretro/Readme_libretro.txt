Libretro port of James Higgs Jum52 Atari 5200 emulator
		(WIP and rough port for now)

Thanks to James Higgs to allow us to port Jum52 to Libretro.

Usage:

- Copy jum52.cfg to your libretro system directory.

If libretro system directory unset ,the emulator try to load it from current path.
Edit it to fit your need (eg: for act palette files)

- You can also copy jum52_libretro.info to the info directory.

Once done you can launch retroarch to select the core and load content.
Optionally you can launch it from command line
 eg: retroarch  -L jum52_libretro /somewhere/somecontent.a52
